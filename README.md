# GitHub Skills Sandlot

_A repository for completing Github learning modules._

### What's next?

If you'd like to make a profile README, use the quickstart instructions below or follow the instructions in the [Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) article.

1. Make a new public repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
2. Create a file named `README.md` in its root. The "root" means not inside any folder in your repository.
3. Edit the contents of the `README.md` file.
4. If you created a new branch for your file, open and merge a pull request on your branch.
5. Lastly, we'd love to hear what you thought of this course [in our discussion board](https://github.com/orgs/skills/discussions/categories/introduction-to-github).
